```python
enemy_team = 'RED' if self.player_team == 'BLUE' else 'BLUE'
enemy = {

}
```

**3. Damage Check:**
```python
for enemy in self.enemies:
    if enemy.get('team') == self.player_team:
        continue  # Skip teammates!
    # Apply damage logic
```

**4. Team Colors:**
```python
if enemy_team == 'BLUE':
    outfit_color = (60, 80, 140)  # Blue
    vest_color = (40, 60, 120)
    helmet_color = (30, 50, 100)
else:  # RED
    outfit_color = (140, 60, 60)  # Red
