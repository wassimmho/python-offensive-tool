- ✅ Message type logging (received from clients)
- ✅ Player movement tracking
- ✅ Shooting events
- ✅ Disconnection details
- ✅ Game loop status updates (every 60 frames)
- ✅ Broadcast error handling with logging
- ✅ Enhanced shutdown procedure

**Key Features:**

- ✅ Initialization confirmation with player details
- ✅ Game state update tracking
- ✅ Input event logging (keyboard, mouse)
- ✅ Frame-based status updates
- ✅ On-screen debug information

**Visual Debugging:**
- On-screen debug panel (bottom left) showing:
  - Player ID
  - Position
  - Angle
  - Player count
  - FPS counter
- Test rectangle (red square in center) for visual confirmation
- "3D Game Active" text indicator
- Enhanced connection status messages

**Error Handling:**
- Try-catch blocks with detailed error messages
- Traceback printing for exceptions
- Graceful disconnection handling

### 3. New Files Created

#### test_connection.py
Simple connection testing tool that:
- Tests socket creation
- Tests server connection
- Waits for init message
- Sends test messages
- Verifies bi-directional communication
- Reports success/failure with detailed steps

#### DEBUG.md
Comprehensive debugging guide including:
- Feature list
- Step-by-step testing instructions
- Common issues and solutions
- Expected console output examples
- Troubleshooting tips
- Performance notes

#### CHANGES.md (this file)
Summary of all modifications made

## Benefits

### For Developers
1. **Easy Issue Identification**: Colored emoji indicators make it easy to spot where the connection fails
2. **Step-by-Step Tracking**: Can see exactly which step of connection/initialization succeeds or fails
3. **Performance Monitoring**: FPS and frame count help identify performance issues
4. **Network Debugging**: See exactly what messages are sent/received

### For Users
1. **Clear Status**: Know if server is running and accepting connections
2. **Connection Feedback**: See connection progress in real-time
3. **Visual Confirmation**: On-screen indicators show game is working
4. **Problem Diagnosis**: Error messages explain what went wrong

## Testing Recommendations

### Quick Test Sequence
1. Run `python test_connection.py` to verify basic connectivity
2. Start server: `python server.py`
3. Start client: `python client.py`
4. Look for these indicators:
   - Server: "🎮 NEW PLAYER CONNECTION"
   - Client: "🎮 INITIALIZED AS PLAYER X"
   - Client window: Red test square visible
   - Client window: Debug info at bottom

### Troubleshooting Workflow
1. If blank screen appears:
   - Check console for "INITIALIZED AS PLAYER X"
   - Look for red test square in window
   - Check debug info visibility
   - Verify FPS > 0

2. If connection fails:
   - Verify server is running first
   - Check server shows "Accepting connections..."
   - Run test_connection.py
   - Check firewall settings

3. If server won't start:
   - Check port 5555 availability
   - Try running as administrator
   - Check for other Python processes

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Log file output option
- Debug level configuration (verbose/normal/quiet)
- Network statistics (latency, packet loss)
- Visual debug overlay toggle (F3 key)
- Performance profiling mode

## Compatibility

- Python 3.7+
- pygame 2.5.0+
- Windows, Linux, macOS
- Works with existing game files
- No breaking changes to game mechanics

## Notes

- Debug output can be verbose; consider redirecting to files for long sessions
- Emoji indicators work best in modern terminals
- Some movement logging is throttled to prevent spam
- Game state updates logged every 60 frames (≈1 second)
