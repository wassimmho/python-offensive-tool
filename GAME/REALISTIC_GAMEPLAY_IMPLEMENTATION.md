---

## 🚀 WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. MOMENTUM-BASED MOVEMENT PHYSICS
**Lines 240-280 & 575-670 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- velocity_x, velocity_z: Movement velocity vectors
- acceleration = 800: Acceleration rate
- friction = 0.85: Friction coefficient for smooth stopping
- crouch_speed_mult = 0.5: Crouch speed multiplier
- aim_walk_speed = 0.6: Aiming speed multiplier
- sprint_multiplier = 1.8: Sprint speed boost
```

**How it works:**
- Instead of instant movement, your character accelerates and decelerates
- Uses realistic physics: `velocity += (target - velocity) * acceleration * dt`
- Friction applied when idle: `velocity *= friction`
- Creates natural "weight" to movement like Tarkov/Insurgency

### 2. STAMINA SYSTEM
**Lines 240-280 & 580-595 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- max_stamina = 100
- stamina = 100
- stamina_drain_rate = 25: Per second when sprinting
- stamina_regen_rate = 18: Per second when idle

# Dynamic Regeneration:
- Full regen (18/s) when standing still
- Half regen (9/s) when moving
- Drain 25/s when sprinting
- Drain 15/s when holding breath while aiming
```

**Stamina gates:**
- Can't sprint when stamina < 10
- Can't hold breath when stamina < 5
- Must manage stamina tactically

### 3. WEAPON SWAY & BREATHING SIMULATION
**Lines 240-280 & 645-665 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- weapon_sway_x, weapon_sway_y: Current sway amounts
- breathing_cycle: Time-based breathing counter

# Dynamic Sway Calculation:
base_sway = 0.02
sway_mult = 2.0 if sprinting else (1.5 if moving else 1.0)
sway_mult *= 0.25 if aiming  # Drastically reduced when ADS

# Breathing Pattern:
breathing_frequency = 0.8 Hz (natural human breathing)
breath_wobble = sin(breathing_cycle * 0.8) * 0.003

# Breath Holding:
if aiming and holding SHIFT:
    wobble_mult = 0.1  # 90% reduction in sway
    stamina_drain = 15/s
```

**Realism:**
- Natural weapon drift from breathing
- Increased sway when tired/sprinting
- Holding breath steadies aim (like real snipers)

### 4. TACTICAL LEANING SYSTEM
**Lines 240-280 & 705-715 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- is_leaning_left, is_leaning_right: Boolean states
- lean_angle: Current lean angle (-0.15 to +0.15)

# Smooth Interpolation:
target_lean = -0.15 if Q pressed else (0.15 if E pressed else 0)
lean_angle += (target_lean - lean_angle) * 5 * dt

# Key Bindings:
Q (hold) = Lean left
E (hold) = Lean right
```

**Tactical advantage:**
- Peek around corners without exposing full body
- Reduces exposure to enemy fire
- Essential for tactical gameplay

### 5. CROUCHING MECHANICS
**Lines 240-280 & 598-610 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- is_crouching: Boolean state
- crouch_speed_mult = 0.5: Movement penalty

# Effects:
- Speed reduced to 50%
- Accuracy bonus: 1.2x multiplier
- Lower player camera (y = 35 instead of 50)
- Smaller hitbox target

# Key Binding:
C (toggle) = Crouch/Stand
```

**Strategic use:**
- Trade speed for accuracy
- Smaller target in combat
- Better for holding positions

### 6. ACCURACY PENALTY SYSTEM
**Lines 610-625 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Dynamic Accuracy Calculation:
accuracy_penalty = 1.0  # Base (standing still)

if sprinting:
    accuracy_penalty = 0.7  # 30% penalty
elif in_air or jumping:
    accuracy_penalty = 0.4  # 60% penalty
elif moving (velocity_x or velocity_z):
    accuracy_penalty = 0.85  # 15% penalty

# Weapon Accuracy Formula:
final_accuracy = base_accuracy × aiming_bonus(1.4) × crouch_bonus(1.2) × accuracy_penalty
```

**Realism:**
- Rewards tactical play (stop to shoot)
- Punishes run-and-gun (like real combat)
- Jumping = terrible accuracy (realistic)
- Crouch + Aim + Still = maximum accuracy

### 7. RECOIL SYSTEM WITH RECOVERY
**Lines 240-280, 720-725, 780-795 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- recoil_x: Horizontal recoil accumulator
- recoil_y: Vertical recoil accumulator

# Per Shot (in _shoot):
self.recoil_x += random.uniform(-base_recoil, base_recoil) * recoil_mult * 0.5
self.recoil_y += base_recoil * recoil_mult * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)

# Recoil Modifiers:
recoil_mult = 0.6 if aiming else 1.0
recoil_mult *= 0.8 if crouching else 1.0

# Recovery (in _update):
self.recoil_x *= 0.9  # 10% decay per frame
self.recoil_y *= 0.9
```

**Weapon feel:**
- Each shot kicks your view
- Automatic weapons build recoil
- Must control spray with mouse
- Crouching and aiming reduce kick

### 8. JUMP MECHANICS WITH GRAVITY
**Lines 240-280, 495-505, 745-765 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Variables Added:
- is_jumping, in_air: Jump states
- jump_velocity: Vertical velocity
- gravity = 980: Realistic gravity constant (9.8 m/s²)

# Jump Physics:
SPACE pressed → jump_velocity = -350 (upward)
Every frame → jump_velocity += 980 * dt (gravity)
Every frame → player_y += jump_velocity * dt

# Ground Collision:
if player_y >= 50:  # Hit ground
    player_y = 50
    jump_velocity = 0
    in_air = False
    
# Landing Impact:
if abs(jump_velocity) > 200:
    screen_shake = 3  # Hard landing
```

**Realistic jumping:**
- Can't jump when already in air
- Gravity pulls you down (parabolic arc)
- Landing impact creates screen shake
- Accuracy penalty while airborne

### 9. REALISTIC BULLET BALLISTICS
**Lines 755-845 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Bullet Properties:
- speed: 1200 units/sec (supersonic)
- velocity_y: Vertical velocity component
- gravity: 180 units/s² (bullet drop)
- wind_offset: Cumulative wind deflection
- max_distance: 2500 units

# Ballistic Physics (in _update_bullets):
# Horizontal
bullet['x'] += cos(angle) * speed * dt
bullet['z'] += sin(angle) * speed * dt

# Vertical (gravity)
bullet['velocity_y'] -= gravity * dt
bullet['y'] += velocity_y * dt + vertical_angle * speed * dt

# Wind Deflection
bullet['wind_offset'] += wind_effect * dt * random(-1, 1)
bullet['angle'] += wind_offset * 0.001
```

**Realism:**
- Bullets affected by gravity (drop over distance)
- Must aim above target at long range
- Wind subtly deflects trajectory
- Realistic ballistic arc

### 10. ENHANCED SHOOTING MECHANICS
**Lines 755-845 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Accuracy Calculation:
base_accuracy = weapon.accuracy
aiming_bonus = 1.4 if aiming else 1.0
crouch_bonus = 1.2 if crouching else 1.0
movement_penalty = accuracy_penalty  # From movement state

final_accuracy = base × aiming × crouch × movement
final_accuracy = min(1.0, final_accuracy)  # Cap at 100%

# Spread Cone:
max_spread = 0.15 radians
spread = (1.0 - final_accuracy) * max_spread
angle_offset = random.uniform(-spread, spread)
vertical_offset = random.uniform(-spread * 0.8, spread * 0.8)

# Visual Effects Per Shot:
- Muzzle flash (timed)
- Gun smoke (3-5 particles)
- Shell casing ejection (physics-based)
- Tracer rounds (25% chance on auto weapons)
- Screen shake (weapon-dependent)
```

**Combat feel:**
- Every mechanic affects accuracy
- Visible feedback (smoke, flash, casings)
- Tracers for automatic weapons
- Screen kick from recoil

### 11. HEAD BOBBING ANIMATION
**Lines 630-645 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Head Bob Calculation:
if moving:
    camera_bob += bob_speed * dt
    
    bob_speed = 8 if sprinting else 5
    bob_amount = 0.015 if sprinting else 0.008
    
    vertical_offset = sin(camera_bob) * bob_amount
    horizontal_offset = cos(camera_bob * 0.5) * bob_amount * 0.5
```

**Immersion:**
- Natural head movement while walking
- Faster bobbing when sprinting
- Adds realism to first-person view

### 12. DYNAMIC MOUSE SENSITIVITY
**Lines 720-735 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Sensitivity Modifiers:
if aiming:
    sensitivity = mouse_sensitivity * 0.4  # 60% slower
elif sprinting:
    sensitivity = mouse_sensitivity * 1.2  # 20% faster
else:
    sensitivity = mouse_sensitivity  # Normal

# Applied to look:
player_angle += (mouse_dx * sensitivity) + recoil_x + breath_offset
```

**Control feel:**
- Precision aiming when ADS
- Responsive sprint turning
- Natural sensitivity scaling

### 13. SCREEN SHAKE SYSTEM
**Lines 240-280, 735-745 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# Screen Shake Sources:
- Weapon recoil (per shot)
- Hard landing (jump impact)
- Heavy weapons (1.5x multiplier)

# Shake Physics:
if screen_shake > 0:
    screen_shake -= dt * 6  # Decay
    shake_amount = screen_shake * 0.01
    
    # Apply to view
    player_angle += random.uniform(-shake_amount, shake_amount)
    screen_shake_x = random.uniform(-5, 5) * screen_shake
    screen_shake_y = random.uniform(-5, 5) * screen_shake
else:
    # Smooth damping
    screen_shake_x *= 0.8
    screen_shake_y *= 0.8
```

**Impact feel:**
- Weapons have weight
- Landing creates impact
- Smooth decay to zero

### 14. ENHANCED HUD INDICATORS
**Lines 2850-2950 in PLAY_FPS_GAME.py**

```python
# New HUD Elements:

1. Crouch Indicator (bottom-left)
   "🧎 CROUCH" - Cyan badge when crouching
